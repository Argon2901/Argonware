        <pre>


            I graduated from Michigan Technological University summer of 2025. There I
            developed my skills and gained experience working in development teams. 

            In addition to CS, I minored in Mathematics and German. From this I gained an
            intermediate understanding of the german language and an understanding that I'm 
            nowhere close to having an intermediate understanding of the field of mathematics.
