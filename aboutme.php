    <pre>


        I graduated from Michigan Technological University summer of 2025. There I
        developed my skills and gained experience working in development teams. 

        In addition to CS, I minored in Mathematics and German. From this I gained an
        intermediate understanding of the german language and an understanding that I'm 
        nowhere close to having an intermediate understanding of the field of mathematics.
