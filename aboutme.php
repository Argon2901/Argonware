        <pre>


I graduated from Michigan Technological University summer of 2025. There I
developed my skills and gained experience working in development teams. 

In addition to CS, I minored in Mathematics and German. From this I gained an
intermediate understanding of the german language and an understanding that I'm 
nowhere close to having an intermediate understanding of the field of mathematics.
